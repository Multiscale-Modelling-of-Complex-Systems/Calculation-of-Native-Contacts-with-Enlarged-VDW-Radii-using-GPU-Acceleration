# Calculation-of-Native-Contacts-with-Enlarged-VDW-Radii-using-GPU-Acceleration
This repository provides a GPU-accelerated script for computing native contacts across all frames of a molecular dynamics trajectory. The calculation is based on enlarged van der Waals (VDW) radii, statistically derived for each amino acid, as described in:
